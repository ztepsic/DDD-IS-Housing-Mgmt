# Domain driven design of information system for housing management

The goal of this thesis is to specify, model and implement an information system for housing management as a web application by applying domain – driven design. We
introduce the reader to the problem of the information system development and the solution in which the business process domain and its model are in the focus of development.

We study and theoretically describe the basic approach to domain – driven information system design. We introduce and describe the notion of the object – relational mapper as a bridge used to decrease gaps between object and relational paradigms within a persistence context of a rich domain model.

We show and individually present essential elements necessary to implement an information system lead by domain – driven design, such as abstractions for the domain model implementation, domain concepts, infrastructure in the form of implemented NHibernate repositories with NHibernate session support and transactions, as well as the application and the presentation layer within the ASP.NET MVC web development framework.

We give instructions for the information system setup as well as usage instructions. Finally, we present a conclusion.
